### Part C: Machine Learning Approaches

1. Feature Engineering for ML Forecasting
    - Generate lag features, rolling statistics, Fourier terms, calendar features.
    - Explore feature importances with tree models.

2. ML Models for Forecasting
    - Compare linear regression, random forests, gradient boosting on time series regression tasks.
    - Discuss limitations of ML vs statistical baselines.
3. Ensembles and Model Combinations
    - Weighted averaging, stacking simple ARIMA + RF + XGBoost.
    - Show how ensembling improves robustness.

### Part D: Deep Learning Approaches

1. Intro to Neural Networks for Time Series
    - Train a simple feed-forward NN on lagged features.
    - Compare with linear regression baseline.
2. RNNs (LSTM, GRU)
    - Forecast univariate time series with LSTM/GRU.
    - Show sequence-to-sequence architecture.
3. CNNs for Time Series
    - Use 1D convolutions for forecasting.
    - Compare receptive fields with RNN.
4. Transformers for Time Series
    - Build a simple attention-based model.
    - Forecast using a pretrained framework (e.g., PyTorch Forecasting or Darts).
5. State-of-the-Art Architectures
    - Experiment with N-BEATS, N-HiTS, Autoformer (using an existing library like NeuralForecast or Darts).
    - Benchmark against traditional methods.
